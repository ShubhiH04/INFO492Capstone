A PFD occurs when the muscles or connective tissues of the pelvic area weaken or are injured. The most common PFDs are urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence, and pelvic organ prolapse. PFDs are more common among older women.
NICHD supports and conducts research on PFDs. For example, NICHD-supported studies evaluate therapies and improve ways to measure treatment outcomes and patient satisfaction.
A PFD occurs when the pelvic muscles and connective tissue weaken or are injured.
Symptoms vary depending on the type of PFD. They may include a frequent urge to urinate, leaking urine, and a feeling of heaviness in the vagina.
Many factors can contribute to the development of PFDs, including childbirth, older age, and certain types of surgery.
A healthcare provider may be able to diagnose a PFD with a physical exam. In other cases, a woman may see her doctor about symptoms she is experiencing.
Treatments for PFDs may be nonsurgical, surgical, or a combination. However, some women do not need treatment for their PFD.
NICHD conducts and supports research on PFDs and on conditions associated with pelvic floor disorders.
NICHD conducts and supports a variety of clinical research projects related to PFDs.

Menstrual irregularities are changes to the menstrual cycle that result in missed periods, irregular periods, or excessive bleeding. NICHD is one of many federal agencies and NIH Institutes working to understand menstrual problems. NICHD supports and conducts research on what causes menstrual irregularities and how best to treat and detect them.
Menstruation is one part of the menstrual cycle, in which female hormones prepare the uterus to support a pregnancy.
The primary sign of menstruation is bleeding from the vagina. Additional signs include cramping, lower back pain, bloating, sore breasts, food cravings, irritability, headache, and fatigue.
Menstrual irregularities can include absent, infrequent, heavy, prolonged, or painful periods. These irregularities can occur for a variety of reasons.
Menstrual irregularities occur in 14% to 25% of women of childbearing age.
Menstrual irregularities can be caused by a variety of conditions, including pregnancy, hormonal imbalances, infections, diseases, trauma, and certain medications.
Health care providers often use medical history, physical examination, blood tests, ultrasound examination, and other medical tests to diagnose menstrual irregularities.
Treatments vary depending on the type of menstrual irregularity and its cause. They may include lifestyle changes, medications, or surgery.
NICHD research aims to learn more about menstruation and menstrual irregularities.

Menopause refers to the time in a woman’s life when she stops having a menstrual period and is no longer fertile. The time leading up to menopause is called the menopausal transition, or perimenopause. Typically, menopause occurs between ages 45 and 55.
NICHD is one of many federal agencies and NIH Institutes working to better understand menopause. NICHD also supports and conducts research on conditions related to menopause, such as osteoporosis and menopausal hormone therapy.
Menopause refers to the time in a woman's life when she stops having a menstrual period and is no longer fertile.
Some symptoms of menopause include hot flashes, vaginal dryness, lack of sleep, mood changes, and loss of bone density.
In the natural process of menopause, a woman's ovaries stop releasing eggs and making the hormones estrogen and progesterone.
Women typically notice the signs and symptoms of menopause without a formal diagnosis from their healthcare provider.
Menopause is a normal part of aging and every woman goes through it. It can't be prevented and normally doesn't require treatment.
NICHD conducts and supports research on menopause and on many disorders associated with menopause.
NICHD conducts and supports a variety of clinical research projects related to menopause.

“Infertility” is a term used to describe the inability of a couple to get pregnant or the inability of a woman to carry a pregnancy to term.
Infertility is defined clinically as not being able to achieve pregnancy after 1 year of having regular, unprotected intercourse, or after 6 months if the woman is older than 35 years of age.
Many different medical conditions and other factors can contribute to fertility problems, and an individual case may have a single cause, several causes, or—in some cases—no identifiable cause.
NICHD scientists and others supported by the Institute are conducting research to identify both the causes of infertility and new treatments that may allow more men and women to achieve pregnancy and more women to deliver a live-born infant.
Infertility is a term that describes when a couple is unable to achieve pregnancy after 1 year of having regular, unprotected sex, or after 6 months if the woman is older than 35 years of age.
​About 9% of men and about 11% of women of reproductive age in the United States have experienced fertility problems.
Fertility preservation is the process of saving or protecting eggs, sperm, or reproductive tissue so that a person can use them to have biological children in the future.
Couples should consult with a health care provider about fertility problems if they have had unprotected sex for 1 year without a successful pregnancy.
To diagnose infertility and try to identify its cause, health care providers ask questions about health history, perform a physical exam, and conduct laboratory tests.
Treatments for infertility—for men, for women, and for both partners—can range from medications or surgery to embryo implantation through assisted reproductive technology (ART).
NICHD studies male and female fertility and therapies for improving fertility.
NICHD conducts and supports a variety of clinical research projects related to infertility and fertility.

Diabetes is a condition in which the body’s levels of blood sugar and the hormone insulin are out of balance. It is one of the most common diseases in the United States, and its numbers are constantly rising.
NICHD is one of many federal agencies and NIH institutes that supports research on diabetes. Although the institute studies different aspects of diabetes, NICHD is not the primary resource for patient information about diabetes. TheNational Diabetes Information Clearinghouseand theNational Diabetes Education Programprovide detailed patient information about type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
Diabetes is a disease of metabolism, which is the way your body uses food for energy and growth. It is specifically related to the body's inability to use glucose.
Common symptoms include unusual thirst, fatigue, frequent urination, extreme hunger, irritability, and mood changes. Diabetes doesn’t always cause symptoms, making it hard to diagnose.
The exact causes of diabetes are not fully understood and typically involve multiple factors, such as genetics and interactions with the environment.
The most common test for diagnosing any kind of diabetes is the oral glucose tolerance test.
The main types of treatment for diabetes are lifestyle changes that include a healthy diet and improved activity levels as well as oral medicines and sometimes insulin injections.
NICHD has a large and active research portfolio on diabetes, its associated conditions, and its treatments.
NICHD conducts and supports a variety of clinical research projects related to diabetes.

Amenorrhea (pronouncedey-men-uh-REE-uhoruh-men-uh-REE-uh) is the medical term for the lack of a menstrual period. Amenorrhea is not a disease, but it can be a symptom of another condition.
Primary amenorrhea occurs when a girl has not had her first period by age 16. Secondary amenorrhea describes women who experience an absence of more than three menstrual cycles after having regular periods.
NICHD supports research on the causes and treatments for primary and secondary amenorrhea as well as the conditions for which secondary amenorrhea is often a main symptom, such aspolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)andFragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI).
Amenorrhea is the absence of a menstrual period. Missing a period, when not caused by pregnancy, breastfeeding, or menopause, may be a sign of a health problem.
Missing a period is the main sign of amenorrhea. Other symptoms can include excess facial hair, hair loss, headache, lack of breast development, and vision changes.
Risk factors for amenorrhea include excessive exercise, obesity, eating disorders, a family history of amenorrhea or early menopause, and genetic changes.
Amenorrhea may be a sign of another health problem rather than a disease itself. It also can occur as a natural part of life, such as during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
A health care provider will usually ask a series of questions and conduct a physical exam, including a pelvic exam, to diagnose amenorrhea.
Treatment for amenorrhea depends on the underlying cause, as well as the health status and goals of the individual. It may include lifestyle changes, watchful waiting, medication, or surgery.
NICHD conducts and supports a variety of clinical research projects related to amenorrhea.

HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, kills cells of the body's immune system. Eventually, this can destroy the body's ability to fight infections and certain cancers.
The most advanced stage of HIV infection is known as AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).
NICHD is one of many federal agencies and NIH institutes working to understand HIV. NICHD's research focuses on the biology, prevention, and treatment of HIV/AIDS in infants, children, adolescents, and women, including pregnant and breastfeeding women. Another institute, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, leads HIV/AIDS research at NIH.
HIV attacks cells of the body's immune system. Destruction of these cells can leave people with untreated HIV vulnerable to infections and certain cancers.
HIV symptoms differ between early and late stages of infection and can be similar to those of other illnesses. An HIV test is the only way to tell for sure if you have HIV.
The most common ways that HIV is passed from person to person are through sexual intercourse and by sharing needles, syringes, or other injection drug equipment.
Anyone can get HIV, but certain groups of people are more likely to get HIV because of factors like engaging in risk behaviors.
Blood tests look for evidence that a person's body is fighting HIV. These tests detect HIV antibodies, which the body creates in response to HIV infection.
There are many safe and highly effective drugs approved to fight HIV. However, these drugs do not cure HIV and must be taken for life.
You can reduce your risk of getting HIV or passing it to others by practicing safe sex, not sharing needles, and taking medications to prevent or treat HIV.
NICHD conducts and supports research on HIV and many related disorders.
NICHD conducts and supports a variety of clinical research projects related to HIV.

PCOS is a set of symptoms related to a hormonal imbalance. Symptoms can affect metabolic, cardiovascular, inflammatory, reproductive, and other aspects of health. PCOS may cause menstrual cycle changes; skin changes such as increased facial and body hair and acne; growths in one or both ovaries, often clumps of ovarian follicles that have stopped developing; and infertility. People with PCOS may also have metabolic issues, such as insulin resistance or obesity.
PCOS is a set of symptoms—including metabolic and reproductive—related to a hormonal imbalance.
PCOS symptoms can include menstrual irregularities, cardiovascular issues, acne, insulin resistance, and obstructive sleep apnea.
Research shows that genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of PCOS; the exact cause of PCOS remains unknown.
Health care providers look for two or more features—absence of ovulation, resulting in light or skipped periods; high androgen levels; and follicle growths in one or both ovaries—to diagnose PCOS.
Treatments for PCOS, its specific symptoms, and its associated health problems vary, but they may include lifestyle changes, medications, and ways to remove or otherwise address increased hair growth.

Preeclampsia (pree-i-KLAMP-see-uh) and eclampsia (ih-KLAMP-see-uh) are pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorders. In preeclampsia, the mother’s high blood pressure reduces the blood supply to the fetus, which may get less oxygen and fewer nutrients. Eclampsia is when pregnant women with preeclampsia develop seizures or coma. NICHD and other agencies are working to understand what causes these conditions and how they can be prevented and better treated.
Preeclampsia and eclampsia are pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorders. Preeclampsia is a sudden spike in blood pressure. Eclampsia is more severe and can include seizures or coma.
The causes of preeclampsia and eclampsia are unknown. Several factors, such as insufficient blood flow to the placenta, could contribute to the development and progression of these diseases.
Women with preeclampsia are at increased risk for organ damage/failure, preterm birth, pregnancy loss, and stroke. Eclampsia means a woman is having seizures, which may lead to coma or death.
Risks to the fetus include lack of oxygen and nutrients, preterm birth, and stillbirth. Infants born preterm due to preeclampsia are at higher risk of some long-term health issues.
The exact number of women who develop preeclampsia is not known. Some scientists and health care providers estimate that preeclampsia affects about 3.4% of pregnancies in the United States.
Pregnancy-related hypertension disorder symptoms can include high blood pressure, protein in urine, hand/face swelling, headache, vision problems, abdominal pain, seizures, & nausea/vomiting.
Providers check a pregnant woman's blood pressure during each prenatal visit. If blood pressure is high, especially after 20 weeks of pregnancy, they do more tests to diagnose the problem.
Delivering the fetus and medications can help treat preeclampsia and eclampsia, but symptoms can persist even after delivery.
NICHD studies causes, treatments, and other aspects of preeclampsia and eclampsia.
NICHD conducts and supports a variety of clinical research projects related to preeclampsia and eclampsia.
Find answers to other common questions about preeclampsia and eclampsia, such as how to reduce risk and whether the conditions are likely to recur in a subsequent pregnancy.

In general, a normal human pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks, or just more than 9 months, from the start of the lastmenstrual periodto childbirth. Labor that begins before 37 weeks is called preterm labor (or premature labor). A birth that occurs before 37 weeks is considered a preterm birth.
Preterm birth is the most common cause of infant death and is the leading cause of long-term disability related to the nervous system in children.
NICHD is working both on its own and in collaboration with other agencies and organizations to learn more about the causes of preterm labor and birth, improve ways to predict which women are at risk for preterm delivery, and identify prevention methods to reduce the number of infants born early.
NICHD also is studying ways to improve care for infants born too early in order to reduce death and disability associated with preterm birth.
A birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy is considered preterm (premature). Labor beginning before 37 weeks is called preterm labor. Preterm birth is the most common cause of infant death.
If you have symptoms of preterm labor, such as contractions or fluid leaking from your vagina, you should call your doctor.
Preterm labor and premature birth have many complex causes that are not well understood. Medical, biological, and psychological factors may all play a role in preterm labor and birth.
Medical conditions, pregnancy complications, genetic issues, and other factors can increase your risk for spontaneous preterm labor or birth.
There is currently no clear way to predict preterm labor or birth. Many research studies are focusing on this important problem.
To diagnose preterm labor, your doctor may do a physical exam and ultrasound scans and test your vaginal fluid.
Currently, there is no treatment that can prevent preterm labor and birth, but some things can help delay childbirth.
NICHD conducts and supports research on preterm labor and birth and on many disorders associated with them.
NICHD conducts and supports a variety of clinical research projects related to preterm labor and birth.

STDs, also known as sexually transmitted infections (STIs), are typically caused by bacteria or viruses and are passed from person to person during sexual contact with the penis, vagina, anus, or mouth. The symptoms of STDs/STIs vary between individuals, depending on the cause, and many people may not experience symptoms at all.
Many STDs/STIs have significant health consequences. For instance, certain STIs can also increase the risk of getting and transmittingHIV/AIDSand alter the way the disease progresses. STIs can also cause long-term health problems, particularly in women and infants. Some of the health problems that arise from STIs include pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, tubal or ectopic pregnancy, cervical cancer, and perinatal or congenital infections in infants.
NICHD's research also focuses on understanding sexual risk-taking behaviors that increase the likelihood of individuals contracting STIs, on developing more effective educational interventions to prevent STIs, and on defining the consequences and optimal treatments for STIs, especially in pregnant women.
NICHD conducts and supports research on sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).

Turner syndrome is a condition in which a girl or woman is partially or completely missing an X chromosome. It can cause infertility and heart problems and alter a female’s appearance. NICHD plays a leading role in advancing research on Turner syndrome by supporting the investigation of its physical and emotional effects as well as potential therapies.
Turner syndrome is a disorder caused by a partially or completely missing X chromosome. This condition affects only females.
Turner syndrome causes a variety of symptoms in girls and women. For some people, symptoms are mild, but for others, Turner syndrome can cause serious health problems.
Turner syndrome affects about 1 of every 2,500 female live births worldwide.
Turner syndrome occurs when part or all of an X chromosome is missing from most or all of the cells in a girl’s body.
Healthcare providers use a combination of physical symptoms and the results of a genetic blood test, called a karyotype, to determine the chromosomal characteristics of the cells in a female’s body.
Although there is no cure for Turner syndrome, some treatments can help minimize its symptoms, including human growth hormone and estrogen replacement therapy.
NICHD conducts and supports research on Turner syndrome and on many disorders associated with Turner syndrome.
NICHD conducts and supports a variety of clinical research projects related to Turner syndrome.

Learn how NIH isaccelerating research to prevent maternal morbidity and mortality.
Maternal morbiditydescribes any short- or long-term health problems that result from being pregnant and giving birth.Maternal mortalityrefers to the death of a woman from complications of pregnancy or childbirth that occur during the pregnancy or within 6 weeks after the pregnancy ends.
NICHD is one of many federal agencies working to improve maternal health and pregnancy outcomes, with the goal of preventing and treating pregnancy-related complications to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality. Our efforts aim to improve understanding, early diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of pregnancy and birth complications, as well as improve the data collected on maternal deaths and track general trends to inform research strategies.
Maternal morbidity and mortality—pregnancy-related short- and long-term health problems and deaths, respectively—are major health concerns in the United States.
Age, health status, and other factors can increase the risk of maternal morbidity or mortality. Changes can reduce some risk, but not all factors are changeable.
Pregnancy complications, a chain of medical events started by pregnancy, the worsening of an existing problem from pregnancy, and other factors can cause maternal morbidity and mortality.
Sometimes care before, during, or after pregnancy can help prevent problems that lead to maternal morbidity and mortality. In other cases, health problems or deaths may not be preventable.
NICHD conducts and supports research on pregnancy, childbirth, and other topics related to maternal morbidity and mortality.
NICHD conducts and supports a variety of clinical research projects related to maternal health and conditions that may lead to maternal morbidity or mortality.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal infection in women of reproductive age. It increases the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases and may play a role in premature labor.
NICHD is one of many federal agencies and NIH institutes working to understand BV and to educate women about what it is and how to avoid it. NICHD supports and conducts research on the risks of BV and ways to prevent and treat it.
BV is the most common vaginal infection in women of reproductive age. A change in the balance of bacteria that normally live in the vagina causes BV.
The most common symptom of BV is an increased vaginal discharge that usually has a “fishy” odor. A woman may feel a burning sensation or, in rare cases, itching, when she urinates.
Usually, “good” bacteria outnumber “bad” bacteria in your vagina. But if “bad” bacteria become too numerous, they upset the natural balance and “good” bacteria decrease. This imbalance causes BV.
Diagnosis of BV requires a vaginal exam by a qualified healthcare provider and the laboratory testing of fluid collected from the vagina.
Prescription antibiotics can cure BV by helping to readjust the balance of bacteria in the vagina. Currently, this is the only effective way to cure BV.
Currently, the only effective treatments for BV are prescribed antibiotics. These are prescribed as oral medications or as a gel or cream.
NICHD joins other NIH institutes in research efforts to advance understanding of the causes, preventative measures, and treatment for bacterial vaginosis.
NICHD conducts and supports a variety of clinical research projects related to bacterial vaginosis.
Find answers to other common questions about bacterial vaginosis, such as how BV affects pregnancy and ways to lower the risk of developing BV.

In 1991, NICHD-supported scientists discovered the gene (FMR1) that causesFragile X syndrome (FXS)on the X chromosome. FXS is the most common form of inherited intellectual and developmental disabilities. More recently, researchers have identified two disorders—FXPOI and Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome—that also are associated with changes in theFMR1gene, but that have features and symptoms vastly different from FXS. Women with FXPOI often experience irregular menstrual periods, early infertility, and premature menopause. They are also at increased risk for heart disease and osteoporosis.
Researchers working for and with support from across the NIH have made significant advances in understanding FXPOI.
FXPOI is the term used to describe a loss of normal function of the ovaries before the age of 40 in women who have a premutation in theirFMR1gene located on the X chromosome.
Women who have a premutation in theFMR1gene are at risk of having premature ovarian insufficiency, a condition called FXPOI.
Fragile X syndrome and its associated conditions are caused  by mutations in theFMR1gene.  The mutation affects how the gene functions in making a specific protein,  called FMRP.
FXPOI causes symptoms similar to other types of ovarian insufficiency, including irregular menstrual periods, unusually short menstrual cycles, infertility, symptoms of menopause, and early menopause.
Healthcare providers may suggest genetic testing for a person who has a family history of Fragile X syndrome, infertility, or early menopause.
Although there are treatments for some of the symptoms of FXPOI, such as hot flashes, there is currently no treatment to cure or reverse infertility related to FXPOI.
Currently no proven treatment will restore normal function to a woman's ovaries if she has FXPOI. There are fertility treatment options.
There are several effective treatments for some of the other symptoms of FXPOI, such as those related to menopause—hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, irritability, and poor concentration.
NICHD conducts and supports research on FXPOI and on many disorders associated with FXPOI.
NICHD conducts and supports a variety of clinical research projects related to FXPOI.
Find answers to other common questions about FXPOI, such as early menopause, conditions associated with FXPOI, and how theFMR1gene changes as it is passed from parent to child.

Types of assistive devices and their use.
Types of rehabilitative technologies and their use.
Rehabilitative and assistive technology refers to tools, equipment, or products that can help people with disabilities successfully complete activities at school, home, work, and in the community. Disabilities are disorders, diseases, health conditions, or injuries that affect a person’s physical, intellectual, or mental well-being and functioning. Rehabilitative and assistive technologies can help people with disabilities function more easily in their everyday lives and can also make it easier for a caregiver to care for a person with disabilities. The term “rehabilitative technology” refers to aids that help people recover their functioning after injury or illness. “Assistive technologies” may be as simple as a magnifying glass to improve vision or as complex as a digital communication system.
Some of these technologies are made possible through rehabilitative engineering research, which applies engineering and scientific principles to study how people with disabilities function in society. It includes studying barriers and designing solutions so that people with disabilities can interact successfully in their environments.
NICHD houses theNational Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research (NCMRR), which is charged with advancing scientific knowledge on disabilities and rehabilitation, while also providing vital support and focus for the field of medical rehabilitation to help ensure the health, independence, productivity, and quality of life of all people. Through the NCMRR, NICHD supports the development and testing of rehabilitative and assistive technologies, with a focus on physical rehabilitation.
Rehabilitative and assistive technology helps people with disabilities complete activities. The technology can be simple, like a magnifying glass, or complex, like virtual reality.
Assistive devices include mobility aids, computer technology, and other tools to help people with disabilities complete activities.
Rehabilitative technologies—such as robotics, transcranial stimulation, and movement analysis—help people recover or improve function after injury or illness.
Rehabilitative and assistive technology can help people with disabilities regain or improve function, or compensate for a limitation.
NICHD conducts and supports research on rehabilitative and assistive technology and on many disorders that may benefit from these fields of research.
NICHD conducts and supports a variety of clinical research projects related to rehabilitative and assistive technology.

Pregnancy loss occurs when a pregnancy ends unexpectedly before the 20th week. It is sometimes called early pregnancy loss, mid-trimester pregnancy loss, miscarriage, spontaneous abortion, or fetal demise. We use the term "pregnancy loss" throughout this information.
NICHD supports and conducts research on the causes of this type of pregnancy loss and other topics that affect maternal health, fertility, and the likelihood of a successful pregnancy.
Additional research on pregnancy and pregnancy complications also informs our knowledge about pregnancy loss, in keeping with the overarching NICHD goal of helping women have healthy pregnancies that result in healthy babies.
Pregnancy loss before 20 weeks of pregnancy is the spontaneous loss of a fetus within this time frame of pregnancy.

Vulvodynia is chronic pain or discomfort of the vulva. Researchers and health care providers currently know little about why and how vulvodynia occurs—the condition and the pain have no known cause or cure. Therapies can help relieve symptoms of vulvodynia, but the condition can have some serious effects on women's reproductive health and day-to-day life. Understanding vulvodynia is an important part of NICHD's mission to improve women's quality of life.
Vulvodynia is a term used to describe chronic pain (lasting at least 3 months) of the vulva that does not have a clear cause, such as an infection or cancer.
Health care providers do not know what causes vulvodynia. It tends to be diagnosed when other causes of vulvar pain, such as infection or skin diseases, are ruled out.
Vulvodynia tends to be diagnosed only when other causes of vulvar pain, such as infection or skin diseases, have been ruled out.
There are several options to treat the symptoms of vulvodynia. These may include lifestyle changes and therapy, medical treatment, and surgical treatment.
Research to understand vulvodynia can improve women's health and quality of life.
NICHD conducts and supports a variety of clinical research projects related to vulvodynia.

Pre-Pregnancy care is the health care a woman gets before she becomes pregnant. Prenatal care is the health care a woman gets duringpregnancy. Early and regular prenatal visits with a health care provider are important for the health of both the mother and the fetus. Pre-Pregnancy care from a health care provider is also important to help a woman have as healthy a pregnancy as possible.
Pre-Pregnancy care is the health care a woman receives before she gets pregnant. Prenatal care is the health care a woman gets during pregnancy. Both can help promote a healthy pregnancy.
Getting chronic health conditions under control and quitting smoking are among the things a woman can do before she gets pregnant to improve the chances of a healthy pregnancy.
Talking to your health care provider about your health history and lifestyle before you get pregnant can help determine what tests or other actions you might need for a healthy pregnancy.
Getting early and regular prenatal care is the best thing you can do to keep yourself and your developing fetus healthy while you are pregnant.
The specific activities for a prenatal visit depend on how far along you are in your pregnancy and your overall health status.
Health care providers run several routine tests during pregnancy. Some women may undergo additional testing because of their age, health, family health history, and ethnicity.
A number of possible problems can occur during pregnancy. Regular prenatal visits can help identify such problems early and allow treatment or management to maintain a healthy pregnancy.
Some women are at increased risk for health problems during pregnancy based on age, existing health conditions, problems they had in previous pregnancies, and other factors.
For many, stress is a part of daily life regardless of pregnancy status. So it is normal to feel some stress during pregnancy. But too much stress can negatively affect your pregnancy.
NICHD research aims to promote healthy pregnancies.
NICHD conducts and supports a variety of clinical research projects related to pre-pregnancy care and prenatal care.

Stillbirth refers to the death of a fetus at or after the 20th week of pregnancy.
Research has found risk factors, such as the age of a pregnant woman, and causes, such as genetic problems, for some stillbirths. However, in many cases, the cause remains unknown even after an autopsy and other follow-up tests. Some stillbirths may be preventable, but most are not.
NICHD supports and conducts research on many aspects of stillbirth, including mechanisms, causes, risk factors, possible prevention and intervention approaches, and how often it happens.
Stillbirth refers to the death of a fetus at or after 20 weeks of pregnancy. It can occur in the womb or during labor and delivery.
Several factors influence the risk for stillbirth. These differ depending on where you live in the world, and many of them cannot be changed to reduce risk.
Research shows several possible causes of stillbirth, including problems with the placenta, congenital anomalies, and infection. However, the cause of many stillbirths remains unknown.
Health care providers use different methods to diagnose stillbirth, depending on the stage of pregnancy and whether labor has already started.
Management of stillbirth varies but typically includes removing the deceased fetus from the womb, identifying the possible cause of the stillbirth, and supporting the family.
NICHD conducts and supports research on many aspects of stillbirth, including its mechanisms, risk factors, prevention, and immediate and long-term care for families that experience stillbirth.

Pregnancy is a period of up to 41 weeks in which a fetus develops inside a woman’s womb. NICHD conducts and supports research and training to help promote healthy pregnancies, with a focus on the important events that occur before, during, and after pregnancy.
Pregnancy is the period during which a fetus develops inside a woman’s womb. Pregnancy usually lasts about 40 weeks, or just over 9 months, as measured from last menstrual period to delivery.
A primary sign of pregnancy is missing 1, 2, or more menstrual periods in a row, but many women experience other symptoms of pregnancy, such as fatigue or nausea, before they miss a period.
Home pregnancy tests are often the first way women learn they are pregnant. If a home test is positive, a woman should call a health care provider to make an appointment and confirm the test.
Early and regular prenatal care, health care during pregnancy, improves the chances of a healthy pregnancy and birth.
Common complications of pregnancy include high blood pressure, gestational diabetes, infections, preeclampsia, preterm labor, pregnancy loss, and stillbirth.
A high-risk pregnancy is one that threatens the health or life of the mother or her fetus. High-risk pregnancies often require specialized care from specially trained providers.
Infections that can affect the health of the pregnant woman, the pregnancy, and the baby after delivery can include chlamydia, gonorrhea, HIV/AIDS, human papillomavirus, syphilis, and Zika.
Labor and delivery are the processes by which the fetus and the placenta leave the uterus. Delivery can occur vaginally (through the vagina) or by a cesarean or surgical delivery.
A cesarean delivery is a surgical procedure in which a fetus is delivered from the womb through an incision in the mother’s abdomen and uterus.
“Postpartum depression” is not just depression and is not just postpartum. Women can experience depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues during pregnancy and after the baby is born.
NICHD investigates pregnancy and complications of pregnancy.
NICHD conducts and supports a variety of clinical research projects related to pregnancy and complications of pregnancy.

Breastfeeding provides an infant with essential calories, vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients for optimal growth, health, and development. Breastfeeding is beneficial to both a mother and her infant and also offers an important opportunity for the pair to bond. NICHD supports many areas of breastfeeding research, including studies of the benefits of breastfeeding and breast milk, the social and cultural impacts of breastfeeding, and the nutritional components and mechanisms of disease related to breastfeeding and breast milk.
This work includes theBreastmilk Ecology: Genesis of Infant Nutrition Project. (PDF 298 KB)
Breastfeeding, also called nursing, is the process of feeding a mother’s breast milk to her infant, usually directly from the breast.
Research shows that breastfeeding offers health benefits for mothers and infants, such as protection against infections, and potential economic and environmental benefits for communities.
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends feeding only breast milk for the first 6 months after birth, then slowly introducing solid foods while still breastfeeding until age 1 year.
Many mothers’ groups, health organizations, and health care provider associations provide detailed information on breastfeeding, including when to feed your infant and signs of a good latch.
Weaning is the process of switching an infant’s diet from breast milk or formula to other foods and fluids. Deciding when to wean is often influenced by many factors, such as a return to work.
New mothers do not need to consume more calories during breastfeeding. The estimated calorie requirements for infants are based on their age, size, and sex.
Women may be advised not to breastfeed when they are taking certain medications or drugs, when they have been diagnosed with a specific illness, or when other specific conditions apply.
Removing breast milk is important for mom’s health even if she doesn’t breastfeed. Moms can express/pump breast milk by hand or with a breast pump, then store it appropriately or discard it.
Infants may need additional vitamin D, and they may need supplementary feeding in certain situations.

Healthcare providers use the term “high-risk pregnancy” to describe a situation in which a mother, her fetus, or both are at higher risk for problems during pregnancy or delivery than in a typical pregnancy.
A high-risk pregnancy may be one that involves chronic health problems, such as diabetes or high blood pressure; infections; complications from a previous pregnancy; or other issues that might arise during pregnancy.
NICHD is one of many federal agencies working to improve pregnancy outcomes, including research on the causes and management of high-risk pregnancies.
A high-risk pregnancy is one in which the mother and/or fetus are at higher risk for problems during pregnancy or labor than in a typical pregnancy.
A pregnancy can be high risk because of a woman’s age, chronic health conditions, lifestyle, and other factors.
Some factors, such as chronic conditions, can be treated and controlled before pregnancy to reduce risk. But some aren’t treatable or start in pregnancy, meaning high risk is not preventable.
Treatment for high-risk pregnancy depends on the risk factors and overall health of the mother and fetus.
NICHD conducts and supports research on high-risk pregnancy and on many disorders related to high-risk pregnancy.
NICHD conducts and supports a variety of clinical research projects related to high-risk pregnancy.

Uterine fibroids, or leiomyomas, are tumors or growths made of smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and other material that grow in or on the wall of the uterus or womb. They are the most common non-cancerous tumors in women of childbearing age.
Uterine fibroids can cause pain and abnormal bleeding from the uterus. Sometimes, fibroids can make it difficult for a woman to get pregnant or maintain a pregnancy.
Currently, the only cure for fibroids is hysterectomy (pronouncedhiss-tur-EK-toh-mee), or removal of the uterus, although fibroids can be treated with other methods.
NICHD scientists are exploring the causes of and treatments for fibroids—including non-hormonal treatments and solutions that preserve a woman’s fertility—and are seeking ways to prevent fibroids from occurring at all.
Uterine fibroids are tumors or growths made of smooth muscle cells and other tissue that are found in the wall of the uterus (womb).
Uterine fibroids can cause pain, heavy bleeding, a feeling of pressure in the abdomen, and other problems. Some women may have no noticeable symptoms.
Fibroid risk is higher among women who are older, are African American, have obesity, or have a family history of fibroids.
We don’t know what causes uterine fibroids. Evidence suggests that multiple factors play a role.
Fibroids can be diagnosed using imaging technology, such as an ultrasound.
Fibroids can be treated with medication, surgery, and other methods.
NICHD conducts and supports research on uterine fibroids, as well as their treatments and management.
NICHD conducts and supports a variety of clinical research projects related to uterine fibroids.
